👋 Welcome to My GitHub!
About Me
I'm curious by nature, always exploring technology and how things work. I'm especially interested in cybersecurity, information security, automation, and AI. I enjoy tinkering, solving problems, and experimenting with new ideas.

Why This GitHub Exists
Over the years, I've solved countless challenges thanks to the knowledge shared by others. This is my way of giving back—a collection of tools, scripts, and projects that might help someone else facing similar challenges. Whether it's automation, security, or just something cool I wanted to build, you'll find it here.

What You'll Find Here
🔹 Security & Automation Tools – Scripts and workflows for making things more efficient.
🔹 AI & Experimentation – Playing with AI and seeing how it can be applied in creative ways.
🔹 Random Tinkering – If it's interesting, I'm probably working on it.

Feel free to explore, use, and improve on anything here. If something helps you out, even better!
